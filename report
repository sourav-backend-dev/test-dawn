    https://prnt.sc/MBAuev-MBfiN 
    [ Because FAQ plugin is worked under child theme only! ]
Q2: Other minor things
    a. the logo slider on the main page is a spinning wheel
    Problem Solved : https://prnt.sc/KcabOJtae7UZ
    b. the main navigation menu doesn't drop down the items from the menu (they hide behind the hero image at the top)
    Problem Solved : https://prnt.sc/QdDtc7WvW9ND
Q3: Can you confirm for me that it's ok to delete the following plugins (i can't see how i'm using them) or tell me if its one i should NOT delete:
    a. plugin load filter ✅
    You can delete this one ! ( Used for activate the selected plugins for each page. )
    b. search exclude ✅ ( Hide any page or post from the WordPress search results )
    You can delete this one ! 
    c. sidebar manager  ❌
    No, You don't need to delete this one because this plugin is in use ! we can add side bar in blogs page with this plugin. 
Q4: I final loaded WP rocket. Check out the site speed!
    Basically, WP Rocket blocked the slider and loader and deleted some CSS (styling) code. So, we need to uninstall the WP Rocket. For now, we do not deactivate the plugin; we just change the mode of the plugin to safe mode.


(Mamasutra)
Q1: Can you move WP Rocket OUT of safe mode? It is getting really fast speeds for both mobile AND desktop, which i desperately want. Please LMK the CSS coding that it was breaking and I'll see if there are workarounds.Additional changes: Thrive recommends WP Rocket so I'm guessing the errors are due to something else. I can ask more about this via Thrive.

Now, WP Rocket is out of safe mode and you can use it we were fixed the errors. 
some css breakdown  issue which was occured by wp rocket are following screenshot 
Header removed in blog page but it is exists in editor  https://prnt.sc/QjAJ4UZduNfX
and logo and the slider is working properly for now 


Thrive responded about the logo slider
You can use the Image Gallery element and its galley type 'Carousel' to have a slider like under the 'featured in' section.

I hope you are well. We need your help again on a small issue. We have created two new pages that are not online yet - 
1) SCIU Mace Race and 
2) SCIU Mace Explorer. 
They both have an FAQ section and it needs to be optimized. Currently both FAQs - English and German - are shown on each page.
[5:58 PM] Mace Race webpage
The German page should show the FAQs in German language (see FAQs "SCIU Mace deutsch") and the English page should show the FAQs in English language (see FAQs "SCIU Mace englisch").
German: http://sciu-bikes.com/mace-race-gravel-bike
English: https://www.sciu-bikes.com/en/mace-race-gravel-bike




Today's task complete

report ( mamasutra )
1. Set Header and Footer
    Are you using the wizard or custom css for this?
    No i wasn't use any wizard or custom css this was done inside thrive without customizing CSS.
3. Blog page re-customize
    a. add categories,recent posts
    I don't actually want the customization separating out the The MamaSutra and Dr. Lanae Posts. I was following one person's opinion and it's not panning out to be necessary.
    The one I had most recently up, similar hero image at the top, but the words weren't covering her face. Can you find that one again? I cannot find it in templates or global element templates or anywhere.
    b. sidebar
    The sidebar is ONLY for the main blog list page. And i like what we used to have on that. Perhaps those are elements inside Thrive (like the image carousel solution for the logos). I know I've seen "dynamic" menus and "styled" menus. Maybe thats a solution? I also liked the AFAF image that linked to the AFAF database and the word cloud and the popular posts.
    c. change layout of blog page
    The actual posts showing on this blog list main page should just be the posts shown by most recent post. Then the sidebar item "most recent posts" can go away.

Regarding item #1, the navi menus: where do I go to make any changes to it? Right now, all of the words sort of smush together so that it reads like a word salad on the desktop. Also, I want it all the way justified to the Right side. I am sure this can be done inside thrive without customizing CSS. please point me where to go to do this? Also, the drop downs aren't in the same font. And i'm not sure I like the weird box that's dropping down for the drop down menu. Ugh.
