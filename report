    [ Because FAQ plugin is worked under child theme only! ]
Q2: Other minor things
    a. the logo slider on the main page is a spinning wheel
    Problem Solved : https://prnt.sc/KcabOJtae7UZ
    b. the main navigation menu doesn't drop down the items from the menu (they hide behind the hero image at the top)
    Problem Solved : https://prnt.sc/QdDtc7WvW9ND
Q3: Can you confirm for me that it's ok to delete the following plugins (i can't see how i'm using them) or tell me if its one i should NOT delete:
    a. plugin load filter ✅
    You can delete this one ! ( Used for activate the selected plugins for each page. )
    b. search exclude ✅ ( Hide any page or post from the WordPress search results )
    You can delete this one ! 
    c. sidebar manager  ❌
    No, You don't need to delete this one because this plugin is in use ! we can add side bar in blogs page with this plugin. 
Q4: I final loaded WP rocket. Check out the site speed!
    Basically, WP Rocket blocked the slider and loader and deleted some CSS (styling) code. So, we need to uninstall the WP Rocket. For now, we do not deactivate the plugin; we just change the mode of the plugin to safe mode.


(Mamasutra)
Q1: Can you move WP Rocket OUT of safe mode? It is getting really fast speeds for both mobile AND desktop, which i desperately want. Please LMK the CSS coding that it was breaking and I'll see if there are workarounds.Additional changes: Thrive recommends WP Rocket so I'm guessing the errors are due to something else. I can ask more about this via Thrive.

Now, WP Rocket is out of safe mode and you can use it we were fixed the errors. 
some css breakdown  issue which was occured by wp rocket are following screenshot 
Header removed in blog page but it is exists in editor  https://prnt.sc/QjAJ4UZduNfX
and logo and the slider is working properly for now 


Thrive responded about the logo slider
You can use the Image Gallery element and its galley type 'Carousel' to have a slider like under the 'featured in' section.
